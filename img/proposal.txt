OCR with PCA using SVD

The goal of this project will be to perform Optical Character Recognition (OCR)
with Principal Component Analysis (PCA) by using Singular Value Decomposition
(SVD). In the field of computer vision this approach has been used for facial recognition
and is known as the eigenface technique. OCR is often seen as a solved problem, cur-
rent commercial systems can perform OCR with high rates of accuracy, however with
this project we will seek to formulate the problem in a way which will allow for more flex-
ible or abstract applications.

The first major component of this project will be generating training data and
training the algorithm. The training data will be generated from the fonts loaded on the
developers computer. Using this approach allows for the domain of known characters to
easily be extended by simply loading more fonts. For every non-cursive, latin font (at
least 128 total) a 16 pixel by 16 pixel training image will be generated for each upper-
case letter (26 total), lower-case letter (26 total), number (10 total), and select special
characters (11 total). The resulting 9344x256 matrix will be centered and normalized by
subtracting the mean image, then SVD will be performed on its covariance matrix. This
will give us our eigen-image-space. Mean images will be created for each character
from the 128 training examples, and those images will be projected onto the eigen-im-
age-space. The resulting weights for each letter will be stored.
